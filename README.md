# My Own Introduction to JavaScript
This is my own documentation for JS.

Each section has its own readme which has my notes, also the codes are overdocumented so I can alway look them up with the
formal explanations.

## Vanilla Javascript
Basics of JS. You can find a README with my notes on JS as well and my *overcommented* code in JS.

## React


## My Webpage
When i get to know JS correctly i will build my own website, without freaking bootstrap.
