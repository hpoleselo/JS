MVP = Menor Produto Viável, aplicação rápida...
Concepts:

- Differences between ES5 and ES6: ES = ECMAScript. Different "versions" of JS, which is updated in the V8 engine.. It has a closed loop feedback with the community, so they check what's been used... Lately the community has been complaining about POO in JS, so they make it
more functional component oriented (we're gonna see it later in React.) One important thing to say is that ALWAYS the newst ES is going to be retrocompatible with the older ones. (ALWAYS USE ```let``` why? Read about hoasting and block scope)

- Linguágem de baixa tipagem: o tipo não importa muito, diferente de C. For example you could store a whole HTML in a variable. Why is that so? Because everything is treated lately (by whom?)
- Redux: unir Front-end com Back-end em JS para harmonizar os dois

Vanilla = Plain JS without libraries (e.g: NodeJS, React...)

arrow function doesn't create context.

## NPM: Node Package Manager

```$ npm install``` would install all dependencies based on the ```dependecies.json``` (which updates automatically when using React [and JS too?])
